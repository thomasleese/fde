# Fetch Decode Execute

_A tool for demonstrating the Fetch-Decode-Execute cycle._

## Building

    $ mkdir build && cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make

## Running

Once built, you should be able to run it like this (in the `build` directory):

    $ ./src/FetchDecodeExecute

By default, the program runs in full-screen mode as it is designed for classroom use. If you do not want this, you should run it like this:

    $ ./src/FetchDecodeExecute --no-fullscreen
