# Fetch Execute Cycle

_A tool for demonstrating the Fetch-Decode-Execute cycle._

## Building

You should be able to build the project with cmake:

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..

## Running

Once built, you should be able to run it like this:

    $ ./build/fde

The program runs in full-screen mode as it is designed for classroom use. You can however just Alt-Tab out of it and change the window properties from there.
